# BBC-Text-Classification
This project classifies BBC articles into categories (politics, sports, business, technology) using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes algorithms.
Both models demonstrated impressive performance, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of 96% and Naive Bayes outperforming with a remarkable accuracy of 98%. The project includes comprehensive preprocessing of text data, feature extraction using n-grams, and a comparison of these classifiers to identify the most effective approach for text classification.
